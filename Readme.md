# Background Timer

This project explores the finite background task API for running background tasks when the application enters the background. The process shown here is a simple timer algorithm that fires for 10 seconds and then terminates. This implementation can serve in much the same way a Protocol serves as an empty shell for its inclusion into multiple applications for multiple use-cases.
